Hi GitHub users!

Most likely you are seeing this because you searched for my commit titled "removed password"

Just wanted to say: please do the right thing, when you see people who had commited passwords or just commited their changes to remove their passwords, kindly let them know and give them a chance to change them.
Let's all try not to be dicks, k?

Thx :)
